    "# Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to develop and compare the performance of multiple regression models in predicting the COVID-19 reproduction rate for countries with unavailable data, such as North Korea. To tackle the challenge of predicting data for North Korea, where data is largely inaccessible, we will consider alternative countries for which we do have the necessary covariate data and target variable data. This enables us to test our various models and draw insights that could then be applied to similar regions with limited data availability.\n"
