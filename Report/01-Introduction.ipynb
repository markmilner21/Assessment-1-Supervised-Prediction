    "# Problem Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "The primary objective of this project is to develop and compare the performance of multiple regression models in the context of predicting the COVID-19 reproduction rate for countries with unavailable data, such as North Korea. To tackle the challenge of predicting reproduction rate for North Korea, where data is largely inaccessible, we will consider alternative countries for which we do have the necessary covariate data and target variable data. This enables us to test the performance our various models, establish which model has performed best on our test data and draw insights that could then be applied to similar regions with limited data availability when applied to a real-world scenario.\n"

    "1. Linear Regression:\n",
    "\n",
    "The implementation of linear models serves as a baseline model, acting as a benchmark against which the more complex models we implement can be compared [1]. Additionally, linear regression is simple and provides an adequate description of the linear relationship between input and output variables due to its straightforward formulation and the interpretability of coefficient magnitudes (The magnitude of the coefficient indicates the strength of the relationship between the predictor and the response variable) [2]. \n",

    "The basic linear regression model can be expressed mathematically as follows:\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",

    "\n",
    "Where:\n",
    "- $Y$ is the dependent variable (target variable), i.e. the variable we predict (in this case, COVID-19 reproduction rate).\n",
    "- $X_1, X_2, \\ldots, X_n$ are the independent variables (predictor variables) that are used to predict $Y$.\n",
    "- $\\beta_0$ is the y-intercept of the regression line\n",
    "- $\\beta_1, \\beta_2, \\ldots, \\beta_n $ are the coefficients corresponding to each independent variable. These are adjusted throughout training of the models to minimise the mean squared error between our predicted value for the target variable's true real value\n",
