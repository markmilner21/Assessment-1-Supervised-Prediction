## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
library(ggplot2)
library(dplyr)
library(ggridges)
library(sf)
library(maps)
library(mapdata)
library(viridis)
library(tidyr)
library(rpart)
library(caret)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
# Install the package if you haven't already
install.packages("readxl")

# Load the library
library(readxl)

# Read the Excel files with corrected paths
test = read_excel("C:/Users/markm/OneDrive/Documents/University/Year 4/dst/GitHub/Assessment_1/Mark Milner/test.xlsx")
train = read_excel("C:/Users/markm/OneDrive/Documents/University/Year 4/dst/GitHub/Assessment_1/Mark Milner/train.xlsx")
```


```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
print(test$reproduction_rate)


```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
